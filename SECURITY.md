# Security Policy

This is the default security policy for all repositories under the
[@bsoyka][profile] GitHub account or otherwise owned/maintained by me, Ben
Soyka.

This document explains how vulnerabilities affecting the security of one or
more of my projects should be reported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I prefer responsible vulnerability disclosure. If you've found a vulnerability,
I would like to know so I can fix it before it is announced publicly.

**Do not open a GitHub issue for a found vulnerability.**

Send details to hello@bsoyka.me, including:

* a brief description of the vulnerability
* steps to exploit the vulnerability
* optionally the type of vulnerability and any related OWASP category

I will try to reply as soon as possible.

### Exploitation of Vulnerabilities

Please **do not try to exploit potential vulnerabilities yourself** if doing so
could affect a live instance of a project or if doing so could otherwise affect
other users of my projects.

Instead, I will look into the issue after receiving your report and will
complete any necessary testing myself.

# Code of Conduct

I have a code of conduct for contributors, which you can find here:
